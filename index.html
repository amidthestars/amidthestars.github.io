          <h3>Hello!</h3>
          <br />
          <h4>My name is Claire Huang, and I love to tell stories.</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            Whether it's through a website like this one; through my hobbies of
            digital art, music/songwriting, writing; or through creating natural
            language processing models for chatbots, I'm always drawn to the
            challenge of bottling emotions or experiences. Through my various
            work with volunteering in underprivileged communities and mental
            health awareness, I've had the privilege of helping others tell
            their stories as well.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I currently study at University of California, Los Angeles, where
            I'm fortunate enough to be among extremely talented and wonderful
            peers and faculty. My goal is to continue tackling communication
            problems with machine learning and natural language processing, so
            if you have anything exciting, just let me know!
          </p>

              greenhouse is submerged.

              Fun fact - I almost recorded a mini-album before COVID-19 hit.
              This is not what it would've looked like, but the songs still
              exist.

              I really enjoy stationery, but a lot of it comes in copious

              This was the start of my digital art journey. I think this is a
              screen shot from VIXX's Shangri-La music video. This is the

              Maybe I wouldn't make it this dark nowadays, but I wanted a
              calming space for myself or others to just talk out feelings and
              work through them with a chatbot.

              July 2022's profile picture, Yeoreum from WJSN. This is one of my

              My mom cut strawberries and brought them to me while I was working
              on homework, and I snapped a picture before I ate them. There's
              just something comforting about cutting fruit that reminds me of
              childhood. Almost like I'm doing this to take care of myself, like
              my mom took care of me.

              Another album idea! Most of these songs were written while on a
              road trip, so the name is very literal.

              I really liked the retro vibe with the vibrant colors, and the map
              with the places the songs were written really put things into
              perspective for me.

              I sent this to a friend, and he was like "Is this Arizona?" He was
              right. Thankfully it was my brother driving; I think I was just

              From my trip to Half Dome! We actually started hiking late because

              5AM. This is the closest to an all-nighter I've ever pulled.
